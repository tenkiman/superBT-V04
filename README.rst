===============================

Welcome to the first release of the super Best Track. 

Please see: https://github.com/tenkiman/superBT-V04/blob/main/QuickStart-V04.pdf 
for an introduction and description of the .csv files that are the superBT

This is version V04 -- a beta release the will include more years and data to become V10.

V10 will go back to 2006 and include 2023 for a 17-y record. Additional data on the R34 
(Radius of 34 kt winds or Gale Force winds) from CIRA and ERA5 will give a more complete set
