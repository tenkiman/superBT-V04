comparing the # of developing v non-developing storms using:

p-md3-stm-anl.py  -- analyzes formation rate as # of NN v # of all 9X (9Xnon + 9Xdev)

v

p-sbt-v04-anl-ts.py  -- plot time series of dev v non-dev 9X

Example:
--------

for all EPAC 2022 storms:

p-md3-stm-anl.py -S e.22 -f all.9xlife.1

the resulting 'all.9xlife.1.e.2022.png' files shows:

Ndev: 19   (19 named storms)
Nnon:  2   (2 non developing 9X or 9Xnon)

p-sbt-v04-anl-ts.py -S e.22 -P shrspd -X

the resulting shrspd-e-22.png file shows:

Ndev: 18   (there were 18 9Xdev)
Nnon:  3   (three non developers or 9Xnon)

Why:
---

18e.2022 formed in the atLANTic so the 9Xdev is NOT in the EPAC basin.
Furthermore, while the md3 data file (all-md3-2007-2022-MRG.csv) does
contain 3 9Xnon, they are not correctly including in the md3 summary
file (sum-md3-2007-2022-MRG.csv)

A problem?
----------

Basin crossing (e.g., LANT -> EPAC or EPAC->CPAC-WPAC or WPAC->IO) is a
2-3% problem and over many years does not affect the statistics.
