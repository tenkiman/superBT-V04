1. Intro
--------

I know python2 is deprecated and that it's pretty lame to keep doing py2, but
I'm an old dog and don't need to learn new tricks...

I have converted to python3 without much trouble, so it's up to you...

I also know that pandas is the obvious interface to the .csv files that are
superBT-V04 and I have played around with pandas too...

All that being said...the py2 interface uses just python dict to slice
(filter) and feed both matplotlib for 2-d plotting and GrADS
(http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/grads.php) for time series.

The overhead for reading in the entire 17-year data set is less than 1 second
so no big performance cost.

The code was developed and tested on a pretty vanilla PC (i7 chip) running
OpenSuSE and the anaconda python distro...  details of my techical environment
