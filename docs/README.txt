Welcome to the first release of the super Best Track (superBT). 

This tarball contains the beta version (V04) of the superBT -- a tropical
cyclone (TC) Best Track data set that is superposition/merging/combination of:

1) all TC position/structure operational data from JTWC/NHC (i.e., is more than the
'best track' or ATCF 'bdeck' data available in IBTRaCS)

2) TC storm and environmental diagnostic variables from the latest/greatest
ECMWF reanlysis ERA5 (dynamics)

3) TC rain from three high-resolution satellite-precipitation analyses:
CMORPH/GsMAP/IMERG (theromdynamics)

V10 will go back to 2006 and include 2023 for a 17-y record. Additional data on the R34 
(Radius of 34 kt winds or Gale Force winds) from CIRA and ERA5 will give a more complete set 
of structure information than in the best tracks
